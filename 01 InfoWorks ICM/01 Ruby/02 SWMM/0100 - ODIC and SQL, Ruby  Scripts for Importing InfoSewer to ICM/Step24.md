## Summary of Step24_User_123_ICM_anode_alink_csv.rb
This Ruby script is used to import data from CSV files into an InfoWorks ICM model. The CSV files are expected to be located in subdirectories of a user-specified directory.

## Detailed Breakdown
Import necessary libraries: The script begins by importing the 'csv' and 'pathname' libraries.

Define the import_anode function: This function is the main part of the script. It performs the following tasks:

Prompt the user for a directory: The user is asked to provide a directory that contains the CSV files.

Iterate over subdirectories: The script iterates over all subdirectories in the provided directory.

Read CSV files: For each subdirectory, the script looks for 'anode.csv' and 'alink.csv' files. If a file is found, it is read and its contents are stored in a hash. The hash is then added to an array.

Update the InfoWorks ICM model: The script iterates over the array of hashes and updates the 'hw_conduit', 'hw_node', and 'hw_subcatchment' objects in the InfoWorks ICM model based on the data in the hashes.

Create a selection list: The script creates a selection list in the InfoWorks ICM model that includes the updated objects.

Call the import_anode function: The script calls the import_anode function and passes the current open network in the application as an argument.

Indicate completion: The script prints a message to indicate the completion of the import process.

This script is useful for updating an InfoWorks ICM model based on data in CSV files. The user can specify the directory that contains the CSV files, and the script will update the model accordingly.
