# Ruby Script Summary: Navigating Hierarchical Model Objects

## Overview
This Ruby script illustrates navigating through a hierarchy of model objects within a water supply and wastewater management system. It accesses the current database and network to fetch the current model object and then traverses up the object hierarchy.

## Script Details
- **Accessing Database and Network**: The script begins by accessing the current database and network from `WSApplication` and retrieves the current model object.
- **Parent Object Retrieval**: It obtains the immediate parent of the current model object by using its `parent_id` and `parent_type`.
- **Hierarchy Traversal**:
  - Iteratively, the script ascends the object hierarchy.
  - In each iteration, the name of the current parent object is printed.
  - The loop continues until the top of the hierarchy is reached (parent ID equals 0).
- **Top Hierarchy Detection**: The loop breaks when a parent ID of 0 is encountered, indicating the topmost object in the hierarchy.

## Conclusion
This script is a practical demonstration of hierarchical navigation in complex network models, particularly useful in water supply and wastewater management systems, to understand the interconnectedness of different components.

## Script Explanation

    Access Database and Network: The script starts by accessing the current database (WSApplication.current_database) and network (WSApplication.current_network), and then obtains the current model object within the network.

    Initial Parent Object Retrieval: The parent ID (parent_id) and parent type (parent_type) of the current model object are retrieved. Using these, the immediate parent object of the current model object is obtained from the database.

    Hierarchy Traversal: The script enters a loop designed to ascend the object hierarchy:
        The name of the current parent object is printed.
        The parent ID and type of this parent object are fetched.
        If the parent ID is 0, indicating the top of the hierarchy, the loop is terminated.
        Otherwise, the script retrieves the next parent object in the hierarchy using its ID and type.

    Top Hierarchy Detection: The loop continues until the top of the hierarchy is reached, signified by a parent ID of 0.

    Purpose: This script is useful in applications where understanding the hierarchical relationships between different components of a network model is important, such as in water management systems where components like pipes, valves, and storage facilities are interconnected.
