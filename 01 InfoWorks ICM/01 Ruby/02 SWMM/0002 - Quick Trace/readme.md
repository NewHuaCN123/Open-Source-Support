The given code is a Ruby script designed to work with the ICM InfoWorks Network. The code's primary purpose is to trace a path between two selected nodes in the network and provide insights on the traced path.

Here's a summarized overview:

# Purpose:

The code is used to trace a path between two selected nodes in the ICM InfoWorks Network.
Key Features:

# Initialization:

The current active network is fetched.
The class QuickTrace is initialized with the current network.

# Process Node:

It processes the current node to find a path to the destination node.
It calculates the shortest path from the source to the destination based on the conduit length (if the link type is 'Cond') or a default value (5).
The total length of all the links traversed is kept track of.
Execution:

The user is expected to select two nodes: a source and a destination.
The script then traces a path from the source to the destination.
The traced path is highlighted in the network (expected to be shown as a red line).
Insights such as the total nodes found, total links found, and the total length of links are printed.

# Usage:

Upon execution, the script checks if exactly two nodes are selected.
If two nodes are selected, it proceeds with the trace, otherwise, it prompts the user to select two nodes.

# Output:

The traced path between the two selected nodes.
The number of nodes and links found in the path.
The total length of all the links in the traced path, rounded to two decimal places.

# Additional Information:

The code seems to have been sourced from a GitHub repository and is specifically tailored for ICM InfoWorks Networks.
The script uses a basic Dijkstra-like approach to find the shortest path between two nodes based on link lengths or a default value.
