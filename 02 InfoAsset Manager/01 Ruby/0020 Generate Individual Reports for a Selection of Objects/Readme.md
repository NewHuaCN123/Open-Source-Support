The Exchange methods required for this process are available in InfoAsset Manager 2021.2 and later.  

Within the InfoAsset Manager interface you can create Word and HTML reports for the whole network or a selection of objects.  
If you generate reports for a selection, all selected objects will be in the same single report file.  
The script will generate individual report files for each of the selected objects.  
Currently only certain reports in IAM can utilise this method - as listed at the top of the scripts.
