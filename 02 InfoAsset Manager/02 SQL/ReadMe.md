# InfoAsset Manager SQL Examples
## File Format
The SQL examples stored in this repository have a commented-out header block to provide context/information about the SQL, the 'Object Table' which should be selected in the SQL dialog, and the 'Spatial Search' settings. Some header blocks also refer to images which are in the same repo folder.  
Comments in the InfoWorks SQL syntax can either be for the line after a double forward-slash (`//`), or for a block from a forward-slash & asterisk (`/*`) until an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (`*/`).
