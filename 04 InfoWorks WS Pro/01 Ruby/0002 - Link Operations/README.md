# Link Operation Scripts

## 1 - Simplify Links

A simple script that removes the bends (geometry) from selected links.

## 2 - Expand and Simplify Links

Expands and simplifies links, for example point GIS objects imported into a link type object (like a Valve).

## 3 - Reverse Links

Demonstrates how to reverse a link.

## 4 - Node to Links

A more complex script that converts selected nodes into links, and then optionall expands and simplifies them using the same principle as 'Expand and Simplify Links' above.

Includes multiple user prompts for customisation, but these could be removed and replaced with default values for use in Exchange.
